This will be my repository for the game I create for my CSIS10a Final Project.

Snake Game 

My snake game is similar to the original piece, but I added a few tweaks to it to make it more engaging.

For example, my code makes it so that there are _two apples_ shown on the grid, and the more you eat apples,
the faster the snake moves. I made it so that at a certain amount of snakes eaten, the pace is set to the 
original speed, making it easier to fill the grid.

To run the code, it doesn't need any special gimmicks. It should work perfectly fine when you run it in the main.java class.

I hope my snake game is enjoyable to you all!!!
