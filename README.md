This will be my repository for the game I create for my CSIS10a Final Project.

Snake Game 

Although my version of snake game is similar to real game, the difference is that it _speeds up_ the more apples eaten.
It took time to create this game, but with analyzing what I had to create bit by bit, I was able to create a well functioning game.
